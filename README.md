WordPress Import for Large Blogger Export Files

#Status
This is a work in progress. It does not fully work yet, but works well enough for me as a developer. 

##No Free Support
If you are a developer too and it helps you, great. But no (free) support.  

##Pull Requests Accepted
If you want to submit a pull request so it can get better, please do that.

##Paid Import Service
If you are an end-user or designer and you desperately need to get your large blogger file imported 
into your new WordPress site, I can help for US$500 flat fee, paid in advance. You can probably get 
some serice somewhere else to do it for you cheaper &mdash; and I would prefer that &mdash; but if you run out of options,
